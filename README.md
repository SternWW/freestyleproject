# wwweatherapp

## Useful & Friendly Weather App
Please note:  This application assumes you have installed Python 3.x. It may work, but is untested on Python 2.x.

This app takes a user-input zip code and outputs:
1) The location for the input zip code, including latitude and longitude.
2) The time the weather is valid for.
3) The current conditions at the location specified.
4) A simple clothing recommendation based on temperature(and sometimes a reco not to go outside).
5) A 10-day forecast for the location input

BONUS: For certain current conditions, this app will also output a fun visual representation of the weather!
